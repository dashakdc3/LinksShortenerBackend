I created an alternative option, according to which only unique links can be plased in the database: if the user wants to create a new link based on the one which has been already placed in the database, he is given the one created earlier by another user without having an opportunity to delete this link(user can delete only those links, which he has created). An alternative is placed near the original code in comment section.
